## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our educational platform seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1.  **Do not disclose it publicly** until it has been addressed.
2.  Send a detailed report to `security@cyberguard-labs.example.com` (Note: This is a placeholder for this educational demo).
3.  Include as much information as possible, including steps to reproduce the issue and the potential impact.

We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours and provide a timeline for a fix if necessary.

## Disclosure Policy

When a vulnerability is reported, we follow a responsible disclosure process:
1. We investigate the report to verify the vulnerability.
2. We work on a fix or mitigation strategy.
3. Once the fix is ready, we will notify the reporter and coordinate a public disclosure if appropriate.
